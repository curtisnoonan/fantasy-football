# === PROMPT 02: CLI polish & summary ===
Improve CLI and summaries:

- In app/cli.py:
  - Add --strict flag: when set, if any CSV row missing required fields, exit with error; otherwise warn and skip.
  - Echo resolved settings values at start (from config + defaults).
  - After writing CSV, print top 5 highest MaxBid rows and totals.

- In app/validators.py:
  - add validate_csv_rows(rows): ensure Player/Pos present, Tier int-able or missing.

- In app/io.py:
  - make CSV reader tolerant of BOM and leading/trailing spaces.

- Add tests/tests_io.py:
  - test_read_write_roundtrip()

- Append to CHANGELOG.md: "Iter 2 â€“ CLI polish, strict mode, IO roundtrip tests."
