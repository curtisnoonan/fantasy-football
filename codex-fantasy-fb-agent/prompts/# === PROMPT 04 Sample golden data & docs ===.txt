# === PROMPT 04: Sample golden data & docs ===
Add a small golden sample and instructions:

- data/draft_list_golden.csv with 6 rows across positions and tiers.
- tests/test_golden.py: run compute_max_bids on golden and assert:
    - all MaxBid >= min_bid
    - sum(MaxBid) <= total_cap
- README.md: add "Golden test" section and explicit run commands.
- Append CHANGELOG.md: "Iter 4 â€“ Golden sample and docs."
